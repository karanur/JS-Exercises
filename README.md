# js-exercises-2025

Lisa Foreman and I discussed ideas and strategy on how to do some of the js exercises and what resources to find in Slack.

# Notes
I had trouble with the Alpha API questions, sometimes it would display data and sometimes it would just show TODO when I refreshed the page. I was unable to solve this issue and they premium key did not seem to help.
